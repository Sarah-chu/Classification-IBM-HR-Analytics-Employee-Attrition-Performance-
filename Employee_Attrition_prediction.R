## IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance ##
########################################################

# Employee attrition has always been a human resources problem as it leads to
# higher training and recruitment cost, as well as the loss of talents. With the advance of 
# machine learning, employee attrition becomes foreseeable. Human resources department can 
# have a deeper understanding in the possible attrition reasons and try to make a retention plan
# for those who are potentially leaving.
# In this study, we will try to predict if an employee would resign
# in the company based on four aspects : employees' background, employees' working condition, 
# employees' satisfaction and employees' benefits. We will also try to identify the possible
# attributes of the attrition decision and give the corresponding insights.

### Correlation between numerical variables ###
## Grab only numeric columns

# The darker the blue colour is, the higher the correlation
# Years At Company, Years In Current Role, Years Since Last Promotion ,Years With Current Manager are highly correlated
# which is normal as they are all about the experience in the company
# Also, Monthly Income is highly positively correlated to Total Working Years and Age 
# Percent Salary Hike is positively correlated to Performance Rating
# And Total Working years is positively related to age and job level without any surprise

# except for job level 4 where employees quit get lower pay than those who stayed,
# i.e. the upper quartile of those who quit is less than the lower quartile of those who stayed

## Performance Rating and Percentage of Salary Hike by Attrition

# Employees with performance rating 4 get an increase in salary for at least 20% while those with performance rating 3
# only get an increase in salary for less than 20%
# This seems to be the company remuneration policy that the range of salary increase are set for each performance rating

## Split data into Training and Testing set ##
set.seed(100)

## Split up the dataset, basically randomly assigns a boolean to a new column "sample"
sample <- sample.split(data$Attrition, SplitRatio = 0.7)

train <- subset(data, sample == TRUE)
test <- subset(data, sample == FALSE)

## Examine if the training and testing set follow a similar distribution of attrition
prop.table(table(data$Attrition))
# 84% of the employees stay in the company and 16% resign in the original dataset
prop.table(table(train$Attrition))
# The training set keep the same proportion of attrition (84% : 16%)
prop.table(table(test$Attrition))
# The testing set keep the same proportion of attrition (84% : 16%)


#---------------------------------#
#### Logistic Regression Model #### 
#---------------------------------#

### Logistic regression model with all the features
logit.model_1<- glm(Attrition ~ ., family = binomial(link = 'logit'), data = train) 
summary(logit.model_1)
vif(logit.model_1)
# P-values and VIF(Variable Inflation Factors) of Department are the biggest, Department is not statistically significant predictor 
# and it has high multicollinearity this independent variable and the others
# We will remove it to see if we have a better model

## Model Evaluation - Predict testing set
predict_logit_1 <- predict(logit.model_1,test, type = 'response')
predict_logit_1 <- as.factor(ifelse(predict_logit_1 > 0.5, "No", "Yes"))

## Create a confusion matrix
confusionMatrix.lm_1 <-confusionMatrix(data = relevel(predict_logit_1, ref = "Yes"), 
                                       reference = relevel(test$Attrition, ref = "Yes"))
confusionMatrix.lm_1
# Accuracy = 85.94%
# Recall (Sensitivity) = 46.48% which means only 46.48% of employees quitted are correctly identified from
# all of the quitted employees
# We can see that from the confusion matrix, only 33 employees are correctly predicted as quit
# and 38 employees quitted are not detected


### Logistic regression model without Department
logit.model_2 <- glm(Attrition ~ . - Department, 
                     family = binomial(link = 'logit'), data = train) 
summary(logit.model_2)
# Education Fields seems to be a statistically insignificant predictor
# We will remove this predictor in the next model

## Model Evaluation - Predict testing set
predict_logit_2 <- predict(logit.model_2,test, type = 'response')
predict_logit_2 <- as.factor(ifelse(predict_logit_2 > 0.5, "No", "Yes"))

## Create a confusion matrix
confusionMatrix.lm_2 <-confusionMatrix(data = relevel(predict_logit_2, ref = "Yes"), 
                                       reference = relevel(test$Attrition, ref = "Yes"))
confusionMatrix.lm_2
# Accuracy = 86.17%
# Recall (Sensitivity) = 47.89% 
# This model does a better job than the previous one in terms of both accuracy and recall


### Logistic regression model without Department and Education Field
logit.model_3 <- glm(Attrition ~ . - Department -EducationField, 
                     family = binomial(link = 'logit'), data = train) 
summary(logit.model_3)

## Model Evaluation - Predict testing set
predict_logit_3 <- predict(logit.model_3,test, type = 'response')
predict_logit_3 <- as.factor(ifelse(predict_logit_3 > 0.5, "No", "Yes"))

## Create a confusion matrix
confusionMatrix.lm_3 <-confusionMatrix(data = relevel(predict_logit_3, ref = "Yes"), 
                                       reference = relevel(test$Attrition, ref = "Yes"))
confusionMatrix.lm_3
# Accuracy = 85.71%
# Recall (Sensitivity) = 46.48% 
# This model does a worse job than the previous one in terms of both accuracy and recall
# We will use the second model instead


#-------------------------#
#### Naive Bayes model ####
#-------------------------#

### Gaussian Naive Bayes model 
model_nb <-naiveBayes(Attrition ~ ., data = train)

## Model Evaluation - Predict testing set
model_nb_predict <- predict(model_nb, newdata=test)

## Confusion matrix 
confusionMatrix.nb <- confusionMatrix(model_nb_predict, test$Attrition)
confusionMatrix.nb
# Accuracy = 78.68%
# Recall(Sensitivity) = 67.61% which is relatively good to other models so far


### Naive Bayes model with Laplace Smoothing
# It is a technique for smoothing categorical data by adding a small-sample correction 
# in every probability estimate, so that no probability will be zero
model_nb_laplace <- naiveBayes(Attrition ~ . , data = train, laplace = 2 )

## Model Evaluation - Predict testing set
model_nb_laplace_predict <- predict(model_nb_laplace , test , type = "class" )

## Confusion matrix 
confusionMatrix.nbl <- confusionMatrix(model_nb_laplace_predict, test$Attrition)
confusionMatrix.nbl
# Accuracy = 79.37% which is slightly better than the previous one
# Recall(Specificity) = 67.61% , no change from the previous model


### Naive Bayes model with Kernel Density Estimation
# Kernel based estimation is a technique for estimation of probability density function of the continuous predictors
# It can improve the Naive Bayes model's prediction accuracy
model_nb_kernel <- naive_bayes(Attrition ~ . , usekernel = T, data = train)

## Model Evaluation - Predict testing set
model_nb_kernel_predict <- predict(model_nb_kernel, newdata = select(test,-Attrition), type = 'class')

## Confusion matrix 
confusionMatrix.nbKDE <- confusionMatrix(model_nb_kernel_predict,test$Attrition)
confusionMatrix.nbKDE
# Accuracy = 81.86% 
# Recall(Sensitivity) = 52.11%  
# This model is the best among three Naive Bayes models in terms of accuracy,
# however we focus on recall for this business problem. Using Kernel based estimation
# for the continuous predictors does not improve the model in this case
# We will choose the Gaussian Naive Bayes model as it does a fairly good job on recall
# among these three Naive Bayes models

# Gaussian Naive Bayes model is doing a good job as it is not sensitive to irrelevant 
# and correlated features, also it is highly scalable with the number of features
# However, it does not perform well if independence assumption is not met

#-------------------------------#
###### K- Nearest Neighbor ######
#-------------------------------#

### Data Preparation for KNN Model ###
## Normalize the data for building KNN model
normalize = function(vec){
  if (is.numeric(vec)) {
    vec = (vec - min(vec)) / (max(vec) - min(vec))
  }
  return (vec)
}

## Normalize all the numeric variables ( scale them between 0 and 1)
data.scaled = mutate_if(data, is.numeric, normalize)

## Expand the factors to a set of dummy variables 
data.normalized = data.frame(model.matrix(~ .-Attrition, data = data.scaled), data.scaled$Attrition)[,-1]
data.normalized <- rename(data.normalized, Attrition = data.scaled.Attrition)

## Train- Test split for the normalized dataset
set.seed(100)
sample <- sample.split(data.normalized$Attrition, SplitRatio = 0.7)

train.normalized <- subset(data.normalized, sample == TRUE)
test.normalized <- subset(data.normalized, sample == FALSE)

## Examine if the training and testing set follow a similar distribution of attrition
prop.table(table(data.normalized$Attrition))
# 84% of the employees stay in the company and 16% resign in the original dataset
prop.table(table(train.normalized$Attrition))
# The training set keep the same proportion of attrition (84% : 16%)
prop.table(table(test.normalized$Attrition))
# # The testing set keep the same proportion of attrition (84% : 16%)

## Try the KNN starting by K = 1
predict_knn1 <- knn(train.normalized[,-61],test.normalized[,-61], train.normalized[,61], k =1)

## Confusion matrix 
confusionMatrix.knn1 <- confusionMatrix(predict_knn1,test.normalized$Attrition)
confusionMatrix.knn1
# Accuracy = 75.51% , lower than the 'No Information Rate' of 83.9% which is 
# the best guess given no information beyond the overall distribution of the classes.
# We can treat 'No information rate' as a baseline of the model performance.
# 83.9% no information rate means it will be 83.9% correct when predicting the majority class (i.e. 'Attrition - No')
# This KNN model does a worse job than the baseline in this case.
# Recall(Sensitivity) = 18.31% which is so far the worst among other models.
# This model cannot predict the 'Yes' category well as only 13 of them are correctly predicted

## Elbow Method for determining K value ##
predicted.purchase = NULL
error.rate = NULL

for(i in 1:30){
  set.seed(100)
  predicted.att = knn(train.normalized[,-61],test.normalized[,-61], train.normalized[,61],k=i)
  error.rate[i] = mean(test.normalized$Attrition != predicted.att)
}
k_values <- 1:30
error.df <- data.frame(k_values,error.rate)

## Visualize the error rate for finding the 'Elbow'
ggplot(error.df, aes(k_values,error.rate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(lty = 'dotted', color = 'red') +
  theme_bw()
# An "elbow" is a cut-off point where 
# the error rate would not decrease for using a higher K value
# There is no obvious elbow but We can see that 
# increasing beyond K=12 does not help our misclassification at all.
# So we can set that as the K=12 for our model during training.

## KNN model with K = 12
predict_knn2 <- knn(train.normalized[,-61],test.normalized[,-61], train.normalized[,61], k = 12)

## Confusion Matrix
confusionMatrix.knn2 <- confusionMatrix(predict_knn2, test.normalized$Attrition)
confusionMatrix.knn2
# Accuracy = 85% 
# Recall(Sensitivity) = 9.86% which is worse than K=1
# The elbow method finds the best KNN model with the highest accuracy but not the sensitivity.
# In this case, using the Elbow method does not help for finding a better KNN model.
# We can see that this KNN model does not perform well as it wrongly predicts 'yes' as 'no' for most of the cases.
# Because KNN is not good with high dimensional data and does not work well with categorical features.
# Also it does not work well on rare event target variable since our dataset is imbalanced ( 16% quit & 84% stay)


#-----------------------#
###   Decision Tree   ###
#-----------------------#

## Create a decision tree
set.seed(100)
decision_tree <- rpart(Attrition ~ ., method="class", data=train, 
                       control=rpart.control(minsplit=1), parms=list(split="information"))

## Complexity parameter table
printcp(decision_tree)
# There are 22 features are considered in this decision tree model

## Visualize the complexity parameter table
plotcp(decision_tree)
# Y-axis is the Cross validation error, lower x-axis is the cost complexity ( Î±) value,
# upper x-axis is the number of terminal nodes (i.e., tree size = |T|).
# The cross validation error reaches the lowest with tree size 4 to 6 where
# T = 4 or T =5 are smallest tree within 1 standard error (SE) of the minimum CV error
# we can prune the decision trees with complexity parameter(cp) = 0.027108 
# when T = 3 (nsplit from the cp table )

## Visualize the tree
rpart.plot(decision_tree, type=2, extra=1)
# There are 37 leaves (terminal nodes) 
# The model is too complex to see each nodes and this model may be overfitting
# So we will examine the importance of the features and the tree itself after pruning

## Model Evaluation - Predict testing set
predict_decision_tree <- predict(decision_tree,newdata=test,type="class")

## Create a confusion matrix
confusionMatrix.dt <- confusionMatrix(predict_decision_tree, test$Attrition)
confusionMatrix.dt
# Accuracy = 82.54%
# Recall( Sensitivity) = 40.85% which is relatively high comparing with other models
# However, this tree is too complex and not generalized. If other new test data are used,
# this model may not predict well as it overfits the training set

### Pruning the decision tree ###
## Prune the tree with smallest tree size
# Cp = 0.027108 from the cp table of the previous tree
decision_tree_pruned <- prune(decision_tree, cp = 0.027108)

## Complexity parameter table of the pruned tree
printcp(decision_tree_pruned)
# Only 5 features are used in this pruned tree

## Visualize the pruned decision tree
rpart.plot(decision_tree_pruned)
# We can clearly see the features used now
# The root node is 'Overtime' and the nodes are 'Monthly income', 'Age', 
# 'Education' and 'Stock option level'.
# If the employees do not work overtime, they will fall into the class 'No' even if the employees actually quitted.
# This may ignore other possible features and lead to a lower sensitivity as 
# the majority of class is 'No' (i.e. imbalanced dataset) 

## Model Evaluation - Predict testing set
predicted_att.dt <- predict(decision_tree_pruned, test, type = 'class')

## Create a confusion matrix
confusionMatrix.dtp <- confusionMatrix(predicted_att.dt, test$Attrition)
confusionMatrix.dtp
# Accuracy = 84.35 % which is slightly better than the previous tree
# But in this business case , we focus on recall (sensitivity)
# Recall = 23.94% which is much lower than the original tree
# Decision Tree may not be a good model in this case but we can still identity
# the important features from the tree

### Visualize the feature importance
## Create a data frame for the feature importance
df <- data.frame(imp = decision_tree_pruned$variable.importance)
df2 <- df %>% 
  tibble::rownames_to_column() %>% 
  rename("variable" = rowname) %>% 
  arrange(imp) %>%
  mutate(variable = forcats::fct_inorder(variable))

## Variable importance plot
ggplot(df2) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = variable, y = 0, xend = variable, yend = imp), 
               size = 1.5, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_point(aes(x = variable, y = imp, col = variable), 
             size = 4, show.legend = F) +
  ylab('importance') +
  ggtitle('Feature Importance') +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw()
# This variable importance plot shows the importance of the features which may not
# be used in a split
# Overtime is still the most important feature, followed by Monthly income
# Job level, Job role and Total working year are important but they are not used in the split
# By contrast, education and stock option level are less important but they are used in the split

#-------------------#
### Random Forest ###
#-------------------#

## Create a random forest with default no. of tree = 500
set.seed(100)
rf.model <- randomForest(Attrition ~ . , data = train, proximity = TRUE, importance = TRUE)

## Model Evaluation - Predict testing set
rf.predict <- predict(rf.model , test)

## Confusion Matrix
confusionMatrix.rf <- confusionMatrix(rf.predict, test$Attrition)
confusionMatrix.rf
# Accuracy = 86.85%
# Recall (Sensitivity) = 25.35% which means only 25.35% of employees quitted are correctly identified from
# all of the quitted employees.
# We can see that from the confusion matrix, only 18 employees are correctly predicted as quit
# and 53 employees quitted are not detected.

## Variable importance plot
vip(rf.model, num_features = 25, bar = TRUE)
# The variable importance is based on the average total reduction of 
# the loss function for a given variable across all trees.
# The influential variables are 'Overtime', 'Total working years', 'Age', 'Monthly income',
# 'Job role', Stock option level' and 'Job level' which are identified in the previous decision trees
# But 'Education' is not important in the Random forest model

#------------------------------------#
#### Model Evaluation & Selection ####
#------------------------------------#

## Methodology
# Recall (Sensitivity) : we want to know how well the model detect the employee quitted(TP) from who
# actually quitted (TP + FN)
# It is the proportion of positive result that were correctly classified from all the actual positive
# It is more useful when the class is imbalanced, as true negative is not included in the calculation
# and thus recall is not affected the imbalance
# In this dataset, we have lots of 'No Attrition' relative to 'Yes' and we would like to 
# predict 'Yes' (i.e leave the company) precisely.
# With recall , we can evaluate the models by looking at how well they predict an
# actual 'Yes' from all the actual positive (True positive and false negative)

modelComparison <- data.frame(
  Model = c('Logistic Regression', 'Gaussian Naive Bayes', 'KNN',
            'Decision Tree', 'Pruned Decision Tree', 'Random Forest'),
  Sensitivity = c(confusionMatrix.lm_2$byClass['Sensitivity'],
                  confusionMatrix.nb$byClass['Sensitivity'],
                  confusionMatrix.knn1$byClass['Sensitivity'],
                  confusionMatrix.dt$byClass['Sensitivity'],
                  confusionMatrix.dtp$byClass['Sensitivity'],
                  confusionMatrix.rf$byClass['Sensitivity'])
)
modelComparison

# All the models do not do a good job due to imbalanced class and
# the models cannot detect the true positive well.

### Selected Model : Gaussian Naive Bayes ###
# Only Gaussian Naive Bayes model performs better with recall rate of 67.6%,
# but still it just does a fair job on identifying the employees quitted from all the employees actually quitted.
# With this model, we can only be able identify 67.6% of quitted employees, the human resources department and 
# department managers may need other measures to identify them, e.g. job performance changes or emotion.

# We can manipulate the distribution of the dataset by using different sampling techniques
# to improve the model performance.
# But due to time concern, this would be a further study in the coming future.



#--------------------------#
####    Key Findings    ####
#--------------------------#

#### Employeesâ background ####

### Age 
# The majority of employees who quit (at around 30) are younger than 
# the majority of employees who stay (at around 35).
# Also the proportion of employees in their 20s who quit are higher than those staying.
# We can conclude that the employees quitted are pretty young. This could be they are still searching for their career goals or trying to adopt the working environment.

### Total Working Years
# Employees with 1 total working year have around half chance to leave.
# This could be due to employeesâ own career planning which is natural attrition.
# Another possible reason is the career path in our company is not clear or attractive enough to the new employees. 

# Human resources department may give the new employees an overview of their development opportunities in the company and understand their career interests in order to assist them in their own career development.


#### Employees' benefits ####

### Salary 
# The salary scale of each job level varies, especially for job level 4 where 
# the employees who quit get lower pay than the lower quartile of that of employees stayed
# In general, there is a higher density of low paid (<$5000) employees quitted than those who stayed.
# Human Resources may do a questionnaire for employees who are leaving to see if monthly income is one of 
# their big concerns of working in the company.

### Salary Hike
# It seems to be the company policy that a range of percentage of salary increase is set with 
# performance rating

### Stock Option Levels
# Overall, most of the employees get either level 0 or 1 of the company stocks : 
# Employees who quit have either level 0 or 1 of stock options while employees with level 2 or 3 are less likely to leave the company
# Stock options has becoming one of the most important feature of the remuneration package over the past decades, 
# employees can be more motivated with stock options as the harder they work and the bigger the company grows, 
# the higher returns and satisfaction they get.
# It would be a good idea to distribute the stock options to those at level 0 (junior employees)
# so that the morale would be higher and the employees would be encouraged to stay and grow with the company.
# At the same time, it is cost effective to the company as the company is not giving money to the employees directly.


#### Employees' situations in the company ####

### Overtime
# Overtime is the top influential factor of attrition. 
# 71% of total employees do not work overtime showing that this company treats its employees with care.
# Among those who need to work overtime, half of them quitted.
# Whereas only 23% quitted among those who get off from work on time.
# The manager may consider adjusting the working time or workload for the employees and encouraging
# work life balance.

### Job Roles
# Half of the employees leaving are either Laboratory Technician or Sales Executive,
# managers of the particular departments may investigate the problems behind:
# would it be the remuneration or working environment?
# The managers can try to understand their subordinates' concerns and try to make a retention plan

### Overtime & Department & JobLevel & JobRole & BusinessTravel
# Half of those who worked overtime left their jobs and 65% of employees working overtime are from R&D department.
# And a large proportion of these people work as research scientists and sales executives
#(most of them have the low Job Level 1 or 2) who have the business travel frequently.
# So itâs possible that employees are more likely to leave the company if they have a high-intensity but low-level job.

### Years at the Company
# Most of the attrition at the company happens in the first 10 years of people working there at 91.51% of
# the people who quit do it before their 11th year. 
# The year most people leave is between their first and second year
# on the job with 24% of the people quitting do it then.
# After the 10th year of working most people do not quit, this is probably because of tenure or seniority.
# It is interesting to see that there is currently a higher than average people working at the company for 5 years,
# this could be because of an expansion in the company because it started doing better.

### Years in Current Role
# Most people leave their job either within their first year, 30.8% or in their second year, 28.69%
# There is also another spike of people leaving in their 7th year at their current position, at 13.1%
# This is most likely that people start the job and then realize they do not like it and leave, or after two years
# they are looking for something new. It would be interesting if the people who leave at 7 years would fill out a 
# servery to explain why they are leaving to see if there is any correlation between them all and as to why.

### Years since last promotion
# It seems that a lot of people quit less than one year after getting a promotion at work.
# When this was looked into it was shown that most people who did so, did it after working 
# for the company for 1 year. This could mean that either there is an automatic promotion 
# after working for the company for 1 year, or that that position(s) is very hard and stressful
# and should be looked into.  

### Years with manager
# This investigation could have led to some more interesting findings as there was people
# who had the same manager for less than a year and quit. Since the data set
# did not include peopleâs names and who was their manager, human resources department may need to 
# further investigate if it was a specific manager people had that quit.


#### Employees' Satisfaction ####
# In general, employees have high satisfaction rating in different aspect , e.g. job satisfaction,
# relationship satisfaction, environment satisfaction

### Environment Satisfaction
# Environment Satisfaction could be an influential factor of attrition as the lower the
# environment satisfaction rating, the higher the attrition rate.
# Employees with low environment satisfaction ('1') have the highest attrition rate at 25.35%
# whereas employees with other satisfaction levels get 14% attrition rate.

# Human resources can deploy a caring scheme including extra-curricular activities for improving workplace relationship and morale,
# as well as an anonymous feedback system for understanding the difficulties the employees are facing. 
# So that the employees can feel free to express their opinion of the working environment and the company can improve it in return.


#------------------------#
#####    Summary     #####
#------------------------#

### Influential Factors of Attrition
## Our study finds out the employeesâ major concerns as following : 
# 1) Employeesâ background 
#    a) Age 
#    b) Working experience
# 2) Employeesâ working conditions
#    a) Working overtime
#    b) Job role
#    c) Job levels
# 3) Employeesâ benefits
#    a) Salary
#    b) Stock options


### Recommendations 
## We suggest the following measures to improve the employees morale and the attrition rate :
# 1) Career counseling and coaching for new employees
# 2) Stock Options for junior employees
# 3) Working time or workload adjustment
# 4) Employees' caring scheme
# 5) Company promotion system
# 6) Working environment improvement
